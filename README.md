# obj2dprj
Wavefront OBJ to Dungeon Project by EMMIR 2018-2022
================================================================

Java tool for the King's Crook community to be able to easily convert
Wavefront OBJ (.obj) geometry into Dungeon Project (.dprj) files so
that they could be opened in the King's Crook model editor.

Has a few basic command line options like scale, translate, and flip.

Notes:
- Vertices will be clamped to integers so specifying a scale can be helpful.
- Maximum of 2048 triangles per model!

This is a community project so feel free to make pull requests and work on it!

If you have any questions you can join the King's Crook Discord server and ask :)
